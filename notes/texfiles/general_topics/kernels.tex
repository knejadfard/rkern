\section{A Brief History}
TODO: review how Unix, Linux, BSDs, etc. were started. Including a timeline, and also review the timeline of Assembly, C, and C++. The idea is to find out if the main reason for today's kernels' use of C is just the time that they started development and the fact that C was the best and only sane choice at the time. Clearly, after decades of development, you can't just change languages of the kernel. So... maybe it is time for a fresh start!
